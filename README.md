# UID2021: An Underwater Image Dataset for Evaluation of No-reference Quality Assessment Metrics

UID2021 includes six subsets (B, BG, G, H, LL, T): 60 source (raw) underwater images (i.e., SI_B_1), 
and their corresponding 900 quality improved versions (i.e., ERI_B_1_HP) generated by fifteen underwater 
image enhancement and restoration algorithms. The latest MOS values (from 77 observers) of the UID2021 is
updated by increasing 25 observers with original 52 observers.
